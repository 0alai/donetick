## Donetick service
The Donetick service is the backend of the Donetick project. It handles all the data processing, storage, schedulers, and communication with the frontend.

## What is Donetick? 
An open-source, user-friendly app for managing tasks and chores, featuring customizable options to help you and others stay organized.

## Why I made Donetick?
As an avid for open-source, I was eager to create a solution that could benefit the wider community. Donetick started as a personal project to address my own chore management needs, but it has evolved into bigger tool and decide to open source it for anyone seeking a customizable and privacy-focused task management tool

## Features
- Task and Chore Management: Easily create, edit, and manage tasks and chores for yourself or your group.
- Shared To-Do Lists: Create "Circles" to collaborate on tasks with family or your group
- Assignee Assignment: Assign tasks to specific individuals or rotate them automatically using customizable strategies.
- Recurring Tasks: Schedule tasks to repeat daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly, with flexible customization options.
- Progress Tracking: Track the completion status of tasks and view historical data.

## Need Help:
As a project built while learning Golang, Donetick has evolved organically, and some areas could benefit from refactoring or optimization. I'm particularly interested in contributions that help standardize code patterns, improve performance, or enhance the overall user experience or adding new features! 

## Plans :
My goal is to expand Donetick by offering a hosted infrastructure option. This will make it even easier for users to access and utilize Donetick's features without the need for self-hosting.

While maintaining Donetick's commitment to open source, this hosted option will provide a seamless, out-of-the-box experience for those who prefer a managed solution.
